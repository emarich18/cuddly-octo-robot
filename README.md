GBM and Quantum Algorithm to describe financial time series

In this GitHub repository you can read the examples of the codes that I used to write my Master Degree Thesis in Physics of Complex Systems at Politecnico di Torino in October 2021.

I have described the following compounded returns:
- NASDAQ
- S&P500
- DOW JONES
- FTSE MIB
- EURO STOXX 50
- TESLA
- AMAZON
- FOREX EUR - USD
- BITCOIN
- GOLD
- PETROLEUM

For each of this data I have analyzed the daily, weekly and monthly data in the same way discussing the results in the thesis. Here on GitHub I have just inserted the code used for Daily Bitcoin, because the other ones are very similar. Have a good view!
